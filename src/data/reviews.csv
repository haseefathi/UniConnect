1,5,Great University,Columbia University
2,4,"Columbia is a prestigious, well-placed school. It's definitely expensive, so that's something to think about. Expect a lot of work, but you'll eventually get used to it and the opportunities are amazing if you're comfortable with reaching out. Some of my favorite researchers and scientists in high school are now my professors.",Columbia University
3,1,"Columbia is a well known ivy, but to be honest its too big for a undergrad. I felt lost so often and I did not have intimate relationships with my professors. I transferred to a liberal arts college and have never been happier. Columbia might be well known because its so big, but smaller schools have better education and happier students.",Columbia University
4,1,This is a terrible institution with terrible leaders. Students are treated miserably. Need some leadership renovation.,Columbia University
5,5,Love it,Columbia University
6,3,You got pears? Buy one get one free. Pass one to your son forever and ever!,Columbia University
7,2,Hate attending this school and so do a decent amount of students here but none have the guts to transfer because of the name it carries. I should have went to a CUNY school :(,Columbia University
8,2,"Don't expect real teachers, its a research institution",Columbia University
9,5,I love my school,Columbia University
10,3,don't regret it,Columbia University
11,3,Great school,Columbia University
12,4,Great!,Columbia University
13,5,Amazing!,Columbia University
14,5,"Some pros and cons, work is stressful but also definitely a work hard party hard culture around a lot of the campus.",Columbia University
15,4,"A really great university with a very nice location in the middle of concrete jungle. There are a lot of options to meet, mingle and talk. Dept. of Chemistry is straightforward and nice place to be. However everybody is expected to work hard, and it is really a place to go. Tuition is extremely high as well as living costs are among highest...",Columbia University
16,3,"Advising could be improved and there is too much interdepartmental drama between administration and non-tenured staff and graduate TAs. Students suffer because of lack of continuity among staff and coursework. Excellent opportunities post graduation. On campus recruitment, A+++ professors, off campus eats and good social life.",Columbia University
17,4,School of social work.,Columbia University
18,1,Hated every second here. Some of my teachers were ok but overall I felt like I wasted a huge amount of my parents' money.,Columbia University
19,5,Cool place.,Columbia University
20,1,"I went to a summer program - ALP. I had three professors, two of them were awful, teaching us as if we were high school kids, namely, the courses were way too easy, and the professors just did not adjust it. Columbia is prestigious, but the teaching quality of the professors really upset me.",Columbia University
21,5,"I did not take any classes online, so I really cannot add anything to this discussion. If you spent your freshman year at Columbia during COVID and had to take online classes, I hope you can return to campus this year!",Columbia University
22,4,"I have enjoyed my time at Columbia, although it has been hard to find a balance between social life, academics, and extracurriculars.",Columbia University
23,3,"Honestly, I would not recommend this school to anyone who is facing a dire financial crisis because this university is one of the brokest among the Ivies. The financial aid is laughable and the university still wants to increase tuition when the students can’t afford it. The minorities on campus are ignored and neglected, especially the Black community on campus. This school is somewhat segregated between rich and poor. They only care about you as an individual if you have wealth. Otherwise, you’ll be disregarded like the rest of us.",Columbia University
24,4,"Great university with great professors. I really enjoy GS as it's got the feel of a small college with the resources of a large university. There are many sources of support and opportunity built in for the non-traditional student. Everyone has got that ""Columbia Face"" - put together on the outside and freaking out on the inside - so you're not alone!",Columbia University
25,3,"After attending Tufts University and enjoying a challenging yet engaging and nurturing environment and relatively warm, friendly and diverse community. Columbia was a tremendous disappointment. Students are extremely competitive and cold, which is other exacerbated by grade deflations and lack of curves. Columbia very much rests on its laurels and falls short when it comes to quality academics, advising and opportunities considering the reputation, difficulty, and very high price tag. My experience at Columbia has been mediocre, at best.",Columbia University
26,3,"My overall opinion of Columbia University in the City of New York is the University is good. There's the allure of New York City which is just a hop, skip, and a jump away. There is always something to do here at Columbia. The resources are out there you just have to find them. Also, the academics are top-notch, I would say Columbia is just as competitive as any other University in the world. The down-side is the price of admission I don't believe that the price of admission is worth the name the University is.",Columbia University
27,4,"NYU has provided me so many opportunities due to its fantastic faculty and location. The name alone holds a lot of prestige when searching for internships and job opportunities. However, there is a strong pre-professional vibe here and many people here are very competitive.",New York University
28,5,Going to NYU has been a great experience. I've met lots of really smart people that have challenged my worldview. Being right in the center of NYC and the prestige of NYU has made searching for internships a breeze.,New York University
29,2,"Great reputation, great location. Cool place to be for MA if you can afford it. Negatives relate to NYU being cheap and losing good professors during COVID. Facilities would be great if any were open. They didn't even keep their free museum access. Clubs and social limited at this time. Would have preferred UT during COVID.",New York University
30,4,I went to NYUCGA and honestly my best two years despite force to go online for one and a half semesters. My peers are amazing connections to have and professors are very helpful. NYU got some mad connections for research or job opportunities. I completed my studies at NYU feeling more prepared and accomplished than ever.,New York University
31,1,"Haven't graduated my Master's program yet, but I will be honest, I am not impressed with NYU at all. It really breaks my heart because I was so excited to go here. Overpriced, feels like staff don't care, it's a struggle to access work study jobs and funds after approval, scholarships are impossible to get no matter how many you apply to, etc.",New York University
32,3,"Kinda overpriced, but thats New York in general.",New York University
33,2,It was a DISASTER during Covid.,New York University
34,3,"If we can stop getting redirected all the time, there'd be so much less frustration. The math department faculty is (negatively) something else. The chair is so disorganized. I have to write angry emails, complain to my advisor, and yell at the chair just to register for a class. Not worth it. The food is awful &amp; freshman &quot;need&quot; the meal plan. why.",New York University
35,4,NYU is an awesome school in a super fun location! Obviously thinks are rough because of COVID but with all of the opportunities it's definitely still possible to have a great time,New York University
36,3,"NYU is in a perfect location in NYC and you'll never be too far from your classes, giving Washington Square Park a real campus vibe. In terms of resources, often does feel like we are paying for way more than we are getting. Some professors are great, some aren't. Overall enjoyed my time here, largely attributed to the location.",New York University
37,1,Here you wont have the proper college experience. NYU is probably the most overrated college and it is only helpful for students who desire to put their foot in Wall Street.,New York University
38,1,This is probably the most overrated university there is. Very expensive and lots of poorly qualify professors. Tones of students drop up because not help them when is necessary. I had a better education and college experience in a smaller college. Do yourself a favor and go to a school that foster learning.,New York University
39,5,Great university!,New York University
40,5,"If you love diversity, chaos, urban life, and challenging coursework plus hate trumpies then you will love NYU.",New York University
41,4,"Brilliant, when you first get here. Explosively exciting. But after a while the lost-ness, especially if you're a small-town kid like me, sets in. You start feeling small and alone and it's as if everyone knows what they're doing but you. Don't tell anyone or risk being alienated. Don't be different or you're &quot;pretentious&quot;. I just want to go home.",New York University
42,5,This school is so amazing and feels like home! It's exactly what I envisioned and I couldn't picture myself anywhere else.,New York University
43,5,AMAZING!!!,New York University
44,2,This place has a tendency to eat you alive if you're not willing to do the work to carve out your own little place in it. Just come in with your priorities in mind and a fighting spirit and you should be okay.,New York University
45,5,"Being in an open campus would require you to learn to be outgoing and curious as you explore the city and the opportunities around you. You have to make plans to meet up with others, whether you're joining clubs to connect or simply texting a classmate. Classes are pretty straightforward; just be sure to turn them in on time and you should be fine.",New York University
46,5,NYC can't be beat,New York University
47,3,"I think NYU is a diverse, open-minded, and accepting community. NYU attracts a talented selection of faculty, guest professors with some of the most interesting classes that we never thought were offered in any other college. With its very convient location, it attacts a lot students from all over world.",New York University
48,5,Good,New York University
49,4,"NYU is a very great school. The one problem I have run into recently is the amount of students who don’t speak English because they are international. It is great that NYU loves to admit international students, but when they don’t speak English it is hard for teachers and students to participate in conversations or projects.",New York University
50,5,Great school overall.,New York University
51,4,This school is worth attending if you can afford it,New York University
52,4,"New York University is a great school in a great city. There is a lot of diversity that is quite natural to the city. If you come to learn, you certainly will. The great thing too is that there are always opportunities to get involved in. Whether that is gatherings off-campus or clubs on-campus. There is always something to do.",New York University
53,5,A great campus,Stanford University
54,5,Great here,Stanford University
55,4,Good place,Stanford University
56,5,"Stanford offers so much and it has been an intimidating experience because you are surrounded by talented, creative, and brilliant students. It is a humbling experience but allows you to be a better you. Stanford has top notch food, great internet since I visited some schools that had a nightmare of a connection, and top notch academics.",Stanford University
57,5,"Stanford has been a wonderful experience for me and I am sad that I am at the end of my journey here. Stanford has provided me with ample resources, distinguished professors, and challenging classes. Stanford has so many organizations or student clubs to partake in. The weather and beauty of the campus is the cherry on top that makes Stanford great",Stanford University
58,3,Can't complain about a world-class education that really pushes students to become leaders of change.,Stanford University
59,5,Best school in the nation,Stanford University
60,5,"I visited H,Y,P, MIT, but once I visited Stanford my choice was made. The beauty, atmosphere, academics, school spirit, and sports captured me. It has everything HYP can offer and MIT. Stanford would be the baby conceived between Harvard and MIT academically, but with added benefits such as friendliness, welcoming, and warmth. I am quite happy here",Stanford University
61,5,"My experience at Stanford has been an amazing on so far. The academics and athletics are outstanding. The atmosphere is inviting and the courses are tough but it is Stanford after-all. It also supports the undergraduates and graduates equally by investing into them and actually care unlike other schools we tend to hear about (coughs, Harvard).",Stanford University
62,5,"My stay at Stanford as an undergraduate student is coming to a close very soon. This wonderful home has offered nothing, but excellence and I am glad it can stand out of the shadow of Harvard since it is perceived as less, but i often attributed those thoughts to how young Stanford is in comparison to Harvard. Stanford can only increase as we seen",Stanford University
63,5,"Such an amazing school that offers world class everything, literally. The campus is simply utopian like, but classes are very difficult and demanding course load wise. Overall, I love the campus with all of its offerings, but it is up to any student to determine their experience and their GPA. People are quite brilliant, friendly, and motivated.",Stanford University
64,5,Cool school,Stanford University
65,3,Just trying to get through.....,Stanford University
66,4,"The education was spot on. While the food was good at first, it gets a little repetitive. There are very strict on their policies. The social life an acceptance are exceptional. Everyone is typically very friendly.",Stanford University
67,5,"The food, scenery, social life, network, and academics are unparalleled. Drinking can be pretty problematic, though.",Stanford University
68,4,Its cool,Stanford University
69,3,"I'm from the UK and doing post graduate studies in the United States at Stanford. Stanford is a good school with a lot of opportunity, but it's a tad below Cambridge, Oxford, Princeton and Harvard . Overall though the environment is good.",Stanford University
70,3,nothing to add,Stanford University
71,4,"Stanford is great, although many of the good profs are gone :(",Stanford University
72,3,"Amazing academics, great sports, kind of weird culture, social scene is ok",Stanford University
73,4,wifi sucks. would give it a 0,Stanford University
74,2,"Stanford is less elitist than HYP, but makes up for it with tech startup elitism. Physical sciences and STEM are dominant here, and anything humanities- or sometimes even social sciences-related is regarded as second-tier by many students. Socially, I feel as though many love it but if you're asocial it's a difficult 4 years. Mixed feelings.",Stanford University
75,3,"Although Stanford is #1 dream school according to princeton review, as a student, i find this school awful. The professors are famous but horrible teachers, the tuition here is 60k which is a complete rip off for a ""brand name"" university. Also, they didn't have the major that I desired which sucked a lot. I wish I went to a state university",Stanford University
76,5,Lives up to its reputation 100%.,Stanford University
77,2,"It's in a great location, but most of the students are elitist and cliquey. The professors are mediocre; they can research, but they can't really teach. I am slightly disappointed by my selection to go here rather than Harvard, Yale, or Princeton.",Stanford University
78,5,Love this school. Easily feels like home,Stanford University
79,5,A very prestigious university. So blessed to call it home.,Stanford University
80,5,its awesome,Stanford University
81,1,"Stanford is a fine university, but the school is very isolated from the real world and the student body is very elitist. Many professors are outstanding researchers but poor teachers. Most of the students were very bright, but one dimensional. I wish I had chosen a different school.",Stanford University
82,3,"Extremely overrated. There are much better local universities to attend rather than this place. First off, you have everyone competing with each other to get accepted. Then you realize that everyone is the same: high 4.3+ GPA, SAT/ACT scores, and volunteer work. It makes you question everything when everyone is the same and depressed. No thanks!",Harvard University
83,1,The institution that makes your children suffer.,Harvard University
84,5,"Taught course, smart kid",Harvard University
85,1,Harvard is just overrated. Yes I am a graduate,Harvard University
86,3,"I found that Harvard was a school that you bragged about getting into, but once you are there the majority of the people there are the same. All of the students had a 4.5+ GPA in high school but yet when we get to college we are barely holding on to a 3.0 GPA. I think it prepares you a lot for the real world and would definitely recommend going.",Harvard University
87,1,I hated my experience at Harvard University. My profs were awful and I learned nothing.,Harvard University
88,1,Hell on Earth.,Harvard University
89,4,"Going to Harvard is like entering this magical parallel universe bubble where the world is your oyster; you have access to anything you could want. What they don't tell you is that Harvard doesn't prepare you for the real world, and putting it on your CV isn't a ticket to a great life. I loved it there but 5 yrs later I feel so lost and hopeless.",Harvard University
90,5,"Harvard is an amazing place because everyone is there to learn from each other. The courses are what you would expect. To succeed at Harvard you have to know how to write and write well, in addition being an active participant within the university community. Harvard seeks those who bring something more than just grades to the community.",Harvard University
91,2,Very good university but no social life.,Harvard University
92,1,Everyone here is depressed and you'd save so much money picking a different uni,Harvard University
93,1,"I love this school! But I'm very sad and alone, if you wish to be social this is not the school...",Harvard University
94,1,This place stinks shoulda stuck w/ the u of u,Harvard University
95,5,The best,Harvard University
96,5,really good,Harvard University
97,1,WORST school ever!!,Harvard University
98,5,"Very competitive to get into, but once you're in, it's an amazing place to be at. everyone is rude.",Harvard University
99,5,"Harvard was a very meaningful experience and assisted me to become the CEO of my own company. Harvard planted the seeds to success, and I cannot thank them enough.",Harvard University
100,1,it kinda sucks,Harvard University
101,3,"Harvard was pretty good, but from what I hear from friends who were at UCLA, their food was amazing compared to ours. The buffet was still pretty nice lmao",Harvard University
102,5,"BEST COLLEGE EVER, hands down!",Harvard University
103,4,I think its more of a legacy than real stuff,Harvard University
104,5,Molded me into the shinobi that I am today.,Harvard University
105,5,it is very good,Harvard University
106,4,I could have used more of a challenge thank you,Harvard University
